Davidad
=======

While Chuck Norris Jokes is a promising prototype, it has unfortunately seen little development since its initial release.  This chrome plugin is an attempt to rectify that, by retargeting CNJ to [Davidad](http://davidad.github.io/).  

It replaces all instances of "Chuck Norris" with "Davidad"; isolated appearances of "Chuck" and "Norris" will be replaced with "David" and "Dalrymple", but only on pages where the full substitution happened at least once.  

It is not yet available on the chrome store, because I don't have my credit card with me.  However, you can easily install it from source.  Clone this repo, then go to `chrome://extensions` and click on `Load unpacked extension`.  Direct it to the directory containing the source code and manifest, and voila!  CNJv2.0.
